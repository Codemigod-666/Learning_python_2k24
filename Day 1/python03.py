    # This file is for python variables

    # simple program for example
    x = 5
    y = "John"
    print(x)
    print(y)

    # CASTING
    x = str(3)
    print(type(x))  # output <class 'str'> because it is not converted into string
    # type keyword is used to get the data type

    # RULES FOR VALID VARIABLE NAMES:

    # A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    # A variable name cannot start with a number
    # A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    # Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    # A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
